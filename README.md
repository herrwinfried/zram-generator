# Zram Generator

This project is designed to create an **experimental** zram for you.

The graphical interface is in ALPHA version. A bash won't open when the process starts it will be processed in the background so the easiest way to check is to check "systemctl status zram-manual-script" The thing to remember is that if your system uses systemd, it will work.

## Run

When you download the file, the application may not have write permission, so give the application permission to work. If you want to do it via terminal, give permission to run by using `sudo chmod +x ./Zram_Generator-x86_64.AppImage` command.

# Requirements

`bash`,`systemd` and `pkexec` must be installed and active on your system.
