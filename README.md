# Zram Generator

This project is designed to create an **experimental** zram for you.

The graphical interface is in ALPHA version. A bash won't open when the process starts it will be processed in the background so the easiest way to check is to check "systemctl status zram-manual-script" The thing to remember is that if your system uses systemd, it will work.

# Requirements

`bash`,`systemd` and `pkexec` must be installed and active on your system.
